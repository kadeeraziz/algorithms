### Data Structures and Algorithms


This repository is to refresh my knowledge of data structures and algorithms.
 I will be using Python, Java and Go to implement the algorithms and data structures. 


 # Seven step process for solving a problem
 1. Work example by hand
    -Solve small instances of the problem by hand.
    -What should you do if you can't solve the problem by hand?
    -two things might be wrong:
    1. Unclear problem, the problem statement doesn't give you to much information.
    2. You lack the domain knowledge to solve the problem.
 2. Write what you did 
    -Write down the steps you took to solve the problem, as exact as possible.
    -This is a good way to check if you understand the problem.
 3. Find patterns
    -Look for patterns in the steps you took to solve the problem.
    -This is a good way to check if you understand the problem.
    What should you do if you can't find patterns?
    1. Go back to step 1 and try to find the patterns.
 4. Check by hand
    -Check your solution by hand.
    -Check with different inputs.
 5. Translate to code
    -Translate your solution to code.
    -This is where the syntax of the language you are using comes into play.
 6. Run the test cases
    -Run the test cases.
    -What should you do if the test cases fail?
    1. Go back to step 3 and 5 and try to find the bug.
 7. Debug the failed test cases
